<center> <h1> About us </h1> </center>

<p> It doesnt feel all that long ago that it was 2003 and a yarn was had between a high school teacher and a statistician. The music would be great. It would be something that the Newcastle TAFE music school could be part of, and local clubs and businesses would come on board. It would be an event for young people but would engage everyone. It would be given the same respect as a big city event, but be affordable. It would be serviced by local community groups, and it would be fun. </p>

<p> As the idea grew, it gained momentum, was told and re-told, consolidated by a few neighbourhood parties, many a beer and the odd glass of red and Groovin the Moo was born. </p>

<p> It was a philosophy that communities could grow up an event to be whatever they wanted it to be. It started with friends who brought in their friends, and people who were good at this and that, and others who wanted to be part of it just because they could, and their friends and friends of their friends. When it all came together, it took on a life of its own.

<p>It was Saturday 24 April 2005, GTM set up camp at the Gloucester Showgrounds (NSW) and over 1,400 moo crew members gathered to see the Screaming Jets, Killing Heidi, Evermore, the Spazzys and a bunch of local and Newcastle bands. The show hit the road and pulled up at Narrandera in the NSW Riverina, to the glee of the 1,800 people who came along to cap off the end of the beginning.

<p>In 2006 GTM took to Maitland (NSW), Albury (NSW) and Darwin (NT)  where Gomez (UK) played, the first international act for GTM.

<p>Maitland 2007 was the first GTM full house. With Silverchair and The Black Keys headlining, the joint was thumping. GTM also visited Albury one more time with the Hilltop Hoods, John Butler Trio and You Am I.

<p>The 2008 Maitland show sold out again, and also took to Townsville (QLD) with The Presets juggernaut headlining. The NQ people showed they do love to party.

<p>The GTM family grew in 2009 and spread its wings to Bendigo (VIC) as well as returning to Maitland and Townsville over three weekends of magic and mayhem.

<p>A crazy, big year was 2010. Two new shows in Bunbury (WA) and Canberra (ACT) and a brand new beautiful big venue in Townsville. With an epic selection of bands on the bill all five shows sold out, and the GTM team worked hard.

<p>The theme for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 was consolidation. No new venues, but plenty of work to ensure all shows were as awesome as ever. A thorough review of each site during each off-season meant that every show was better than the previous year, and each year the events sold out nationally.

<p>2014 saw the hatching of long-laid plans to venture into the Adelaide Hills region in South Australia  Oakbank were happy to have us. 

<p>2015 saw the tour do it all again across five states and a territory!

<p>Its been quite a journey so far, sometimes it still feels as though the festival has only just begun, such is the fresh energy that the GTM community brings to this festival - audience, artists, team members, local community and stakeholders - all eager to grow something of their own. 

<p>The GTM community includes our audience, artists, team members, suppliers and stakeholders  - it is one we love, have much to thank for and would not want to change in any way, shape or form.

<p>We are very much looking forward to seeing what 2016 brings!
